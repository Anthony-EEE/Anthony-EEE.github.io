## 🔬 Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, with particular emphasis on:

- **Robot Learning:** Developing algorithms that enable robots to learn complex behaviors through machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.
- **Human Demonstration for Robot Learning:** Training users to provide high-quality demonstrations and data, enabling robots to learn more effectively from human input. My work explores how to design intuitive processes and guidance so that non-expert users can generate better training data for robot learning systems.

I believe that the future of robotics lies in creating systems that can learn, adapt, and work alongside humans effectively. My research aims to advance the era of human-robot collaboration, enabling seamless and effective interaction between people and intelligent robotic systems.

**Conference**: IEEE EUROCON 2023 - 20th International Conference on Smart Technologies

**Abstract**: Our innovative model successfully classifies 26 NATO phonetic alphabet datasets with 3900 data samples, enabling the unambiguous generation of any English word through spelling. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of KDE-SSI, achieving an impressive test accuracy of 85.9%.

**Technical Details**: Processed time-series signals and applied trained robust ML and DL models (SVM/KNN and 1D-CNN, CNN-LSTM, etc.) to classify 26 phonetic alphabet words using Python. Came up with a better baseline (ResNet-1D) for our teamwork to enhance the performance of our DL model.
