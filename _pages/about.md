## 🔬 Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, with particular emphasis on:

- **Robot Learning**: Developing algorithms that enable robots to learn complex behaviors through machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning
- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: Designing intuitive interfaces and learning methods for seamless human-robot collaboration
- **Computer Vision**: Advanced pose estimation and pattern recognition for robotic applications
- **Human-Centered Robotics**: Developing robots that can assist and interact with humans in real-world environments

I believe that the future of robotics lies in creating systems that can learn, adapt, and work alongside humans effectively. My research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical AI advances and practical robotic applications.

**Authors**: Wenqiang Lai*, Qihan Yang*, Ye Mao*, **Endong Sun***, Jiangnan Ye*

**Conference**: IEEE EUROCON 2023 - 20th International Conference on Smart Technologies

**Abstract**: Our innovative model successfully classifies 26 NATO phonetic alphabet datasets with 3900 data samples, enabling the unambiguous generation of any English word through spelling. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of KDE-SSI, achieving an impressive test accuracy of 85.9%.

**Technical Details**: Processed time-series signals and applied trained robust ML and DL models (SVM/KNN and 1D-CNN, CNN-LSTM, etc.) to classify 26 phonetic alphabet words using Python. Came up with a better baseline (ResNet-1D) for our teamwork to enhance the performance of our DL model.
